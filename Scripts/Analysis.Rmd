# Sperm
The first step was to assess the effects of microplastics (MPs) exposure on sperm  This was done using generalised linear regression models with binomial error distributions to determine the extent to which exposure to MPs influenced motility and acrosomal integrity.


## Effects of MPs on motility

The first step was to import the sperm motility data and carry out some basic data carpentry in order to get the data in the correct format for analysis.
```{r}
# Import the sperm motility data
data <- read.csv("Data/Motility.csv")

# Rename a few variables
data$Dead <- data$Total - data$Motile
data$Motile <- data$Motile/data$Total
data$Dead <- data$Dead/data$Total

# Convert the arbitrary time points to minutes since start of the experiment
data[which(data$Time == 0.5),"Time"] <- 30
data[which(data$Time == 1),"Time"] <- 60
data[which(data$Time == 1.5),"Time"] <- 90
data[which(data$Time == 2),"Time"] <- 120

# Convert time to a factor for plotting purposes only
data$Time2 <- as.factor(data$Time)

# Rename the groups
data[which(data$Treatment == "CT"),"Treatment"] <- "Control"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.3"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.3"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B1.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_1.1"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.05"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.05"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.1"

# Drop a time point with questionable data
data <- data[which(data$Time !=30),]
```

After importing and preparing the sperm motility data, the next step was to obtain some basic summary statistics about the data.

```{r}
# Mean motility by treatment and time
means <- aggregate(Motile ~ Time*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "mean")

# SDs by treatment and time
sds <- aggregate(Motile ~ Time*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "sd")

means$SD <- sds$Motile
names(means)[3] <- c("Mean")

kable(means, format="markdown", digits = 3, align = "c", caption = "Basic summary statistics on the sperm motility data.")
```

Next, we used generalised linear regression models to assess the effects of MP exposure on sperm motility. For these analyses all models had a binomial error distribution to account for the fact that the data were proportions, ranging between 0 -- 1. We also included random intercepts to account for differences between the different bulls from which the sperm came, and any differences across replicates.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Fit the various logistic regression models
NULL_MOD <- glmer(Motile ~ 1 + (1|bull) + (1|Replicate),
                  family = binomial,
                  data = data)

TIME_MOD <- glmer(Motile ~ Time + (1|bull) + (1|Replicate),
                  family = binomial,
                  data = data)

TIME_TREAT_MOD <- glmer(Motile ~ Time + Treatment + (1|bull) + (1|Replicate),
                        family = binomial,
                        data = data)

#AICc based model selection to identify the best fit model
AICc(NULL_MOD, TIME_MOD, TIME_TREAT_MOD)

#Summary of the model that includes the effects of time and treatment
tbl_regression(TIME_TREAT_MOD, intercept= T) %>% add_global_p(keep = T)
```

These results indicate that although all of the MP exposure treatments tended to have lower motility than the control, these effects were not statistically significant. A figure of the results is shown below. Note: For the sake of brevity, the code used to generate the figure are not shown here.

## Effects of MPs on acrosomal integrity

The first step was to import the sperm acrosomal integrity data and carry out some basic data carpentry in order to get the data in the correct format for analysis.

```{r}
# Import the sperm motility data
data <- read.csv("Data/Acrosome.csv")

# Scale percentages between 0-1 for the binomial model
data$acrosome2 <- data$acrosome/100

# Convert the arbitrary time points to minutes since start of the experiment
data[which(data$Time == 0.5),"Time"] <- 30
data[which(data$Time == 1),"Time"] <- 60
data[which(data$Time == 1.5),"Time"] <- 90
data[which(data$Time == 2),"Time"] <- 120

# Convert time to a factor for plotting purposes only
data$Time2 <- as.factor(data$Time)

# Rename the groups
data[which(data$Treatment == "CT"),"Treatment"] <- "Control"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.3"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.3"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B1.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_1.1"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.05"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.05"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.1"

# Drop a time point with questionable data
data <- data[which(data$Time !=30),]
```

After importing and preparing the sperm acrosomal integrity data, the next step was to obtain some basic summary statistics about the data.

```{r}
# Mean acrosomal integrity by treatment and time
means <- aggregate(acrosome2 ~ Time*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "mean")

# SDs by treatment and time
sds <- aggregate(acrosome2 ~ Time*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "sd")

means$SD <- sds$acrosome2
names(means)[3] <- c("Mean")

kable(means, format="markdown", digits = 3, align = "c", caption = "Basic summary statistics on the sperm acrosomal integrity data.")
```

We also included random intercepts to account for differences between the different bulls from which the sperm came, and any differences across replicates.

                  family = binomial,
                  data = data)

TIME_MOD <- glmer(acrosome2 ~ Time + (1|bull) + (1|Replicate),
                  family = binomial,
                  data = data)

                        data = data)

#AICc based model selection to identify the best fit model
AICc(NULL_MOD, TIME_MOD, TIME_TREAT_MOD)

#Summary of the model that includes the effects of time and treatment
tbl_regression(TIME_TREAT_MOD, intercept= T) %>% add_global_p(keep = T)
```

These results indicate that all of the sperm cells exposed to MPs tended to have significantly lower acrosomal integrity than the control .A figure of the results is shown below. Note: Here again the code used to generate the figure are not shown.

## Effects of MPs on oxidative stress

The first step was to import the sperm oxidative stress data and carry out some basic data carpentry in order to get the data in the correct format for analysis.

```{r}
# Import the sperm motility data
data <- read.csv("Data/CR.csv")

# Scale percentages between 0-1 for the binomial model
data$CR2 <- data$CR/100

# Convert the arbitrary time points to minutes since start of the experiment
data[which(data$Time == 0.5),"Time"] <- 30
data[which(data$Time == 1),"Time"] <- 60
data[which(data$Time == 1.5),"Time"] <- 90
data[which(data$Time == 2),"Time"] <- 120
data[which(data$Time == 3),"Time"] <- 180

# Convert time to a factor for plotting purposes only
data$Time2 <- as.factor(data$Time)

# Rename the groups
data[which(data$Treatment == "CT"),"Treatment"] <- "Control"
data[which(data$Treatment == "CT+"),"Treatment"] <- "Control_Positive"
data[which(data$Treatment == "b0.3"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.3"
data[which(data$Treatment == "b1.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_1.1"
data[which(data$Treatment == "b0.05"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.05"
data[which(data$Treatment == "b0.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.1"
data$Treatment <- as.factor(data$Treatment)
```

After importing and preparing the oxidative stress data, the next step was to obtain some basic summary statistics.

```{r}
# Mean acrosomal integrity by treatment and time
means <- aggregate(CR2 ~ Time*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "mean")

# SDs by treatment and time
sds <- aggregate(CR2 ~ Time*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "sd")

means$SD <- sds$CR2
names(means)[3] <- c("Mean")

kable(means, format="markdown", digits = 3, align = "c", caption = "Basic summary statistics on the sperm oxidative stress data.")
```

After an initial visual verification, we found that we needed to assess whether there was any evidence of under/overdispersion in the data. This was done by estimating the dispersion parameter of the data. 


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Test if the data are under/overdispersed
quasi_binom <- glm(CR2 ~ Treatment + Time, data = data, family=quasibinomial)
summary(quasi_binom)
```

These results indicate that the dispersion parameter was `r round(summary(quasi_binom)$dispersion,3)`, suggesting the data were extremely underdispersed. 

<br>

Next we used generalised linear regression models to assess the effects of MP exposure on oxidative stress. For these analyses all models had a binomial error distribution to account for the fact that the data were percentages, ranging between 0 -- 1. We also included random intercepts to account for differences between the different bulls from which the sperm came, and any differences across replicates.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fit.quasi.binom <- MASS::glmmPQL(CR2 ~ Treatment + Time,
                                 random = ~ 1|Replicate + 1|Bull,
                                 family=quasibinomial,
                                 data = data)

#Summary of the model that includes the effects of time and treatment
tbl_regression(fit.quasi.binom, intercept= T) %>% add_global_p(keep = T)

# Tukey post-hoc test
TUKEY <- glht(fit.quasi.binom,
              mcp(Treatment = "Tukey"),
              data = data)
summary(TUKEY)
```

<br>

These results indicate that all of the sperm cells exposed to MPs tended to have significantly greater oxidative stress than the control. Tukey post-hoc comparison found that there were no significant difference in oxidative stress between the different size treatments, nor between the MP size treatments and the positive control, except for the largest size beads we examined (1.1 $\mu\mathrm{m}$), which did not result in significantly greater oxidative stress than the negative control. A figure of the results across all three metrics is shown below. Note: Here again the code used to generate the figure are not shown.

## MP bead attachment

The first step was to import the MP bead attachement data and carry out some basic data carpentry in order to get the data in the correct format for analysis.

```{r}
# Import the sperm motility data
data <- read.csv("Data/beads.csv")

# Scale percentages between 0-1 for the binomial model
data$beads <- data$Beads_perc/100

# Convert the arbitrary time points to minutes since start of the experiment
data[which(data$Time == 0.5),"Time"] <- 30
data[which(data$Time == 1),"Time"] <- 60
data[which(data$Time == 1.5),"Time"] <- 90
data[which(data$Time == 2),"Time"] <- 120
data[which(data$Time == 3),"Time"] <- 180

# Convert time to a factor for plotting purposes only
data$Time2 <- as.factor(data$Time)

# Rename the groups
data[which(data$Treatment == "CT"),"Treatment"] <- "Control"
data[which(data$Treatment == "CT+"),"Treatment"] <- "Control_Positive"
data[which(data$Treatment == "b0.3"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.3"
data[which(data$Treatment == "b1.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_1.1"
data[which(data$Treatment == "b0.05"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.05"
data[which(data$Treatment == "b0.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.1"
data$Treatment <- as.factor(data$Treatment)
```

After importing and preparing the oxidative stress data, the next step was to obtain some basic summary statistics.

```{r}
# Mean acrosomal integrity by treatment and time
means <- aggregate(beads ~ Time*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "mean")

# SDs by treatment and time
sds <- aggregate(beads ~ Time*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "sd")

means$SD <- sds$beads
names(means)[3] <- c("Mean")

kable(means, format="markdown", digits = 3, align = "c", caption = "Basic summary statistics on MP attachment.")
```

After an initial visual verification, we found that we needed to assess whether there was any evidence of under/overdispersion in the data. This was done by estimating the dispersion parameter of the data. 


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Test if the data are under/overdispersed
quasi_binom <- glm(beads ~ Treatment + Time, data = data, family=quasibinomial)
summary(quasi_binom)
```

These results indicate that the dispersion parameter was `r round(summary(quasi_binom)$dispersion,3)`, suggesting the data were extremely underdispersed. 

<br>

Next we used generalised linear regression models to assess MP bead attachemnt. For these analyses all models had a binomial error distribution to account for the fact that the data were percentages, ranging between 0 -- 1. We also included random intercepts to account for differences between the different bulls from which the sperm came, and any differences across replicates.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fit.quasi.binom <- MASS::glmmPQL(beads ~ Treatment + Time,
                                 random = ~ 1|Replicate + 1|Bull,
                                 family=quasibinomial,
                                 data = data)

#Summary of the model that includes the effects of time and treatment
tbl_regression(fit.quasi.binom, intercept= T) %>% add_global_p(keep = T)
```

<br>

These results indicate that MPs bead attachment did not differ over time, but that the smaller 0.3 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ beads had significantly higher attachment rates than the larger, 1.1 $\mu\mathrm{m}$, beads. A figure of the results across all three metrics is shown below. Note: Here again the code used to generate the figure are not shown.

# Oocytes

The next step in the analyses was to assess the effects of MPs exposure on oocytes.


## Effects of MPs on maturation

The first step was to import the oocyte maturation data and carry out some basic data carpentry in order to get the data in the correct format for analysis.

```{r}
# Import the sperm motility data
data <- read.csv("Data/Oocyte_data.csv")

# Scale percentages between 0-1 for the binomial model
data$Percentage2 <- data$Percentage/100

# Rename the groups
data[which(data$Treatment == "CT"),"Treatment"] <- "Control"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.3"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.3"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B1.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_1.1"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.05"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.05"
data[which(data$Treatment == "B0.1"),"Treatment"] <- "MP_0.1"

#Convert to factors
data$Treatment <- as.factor(data$Treatment)
data$Nuclear_stage <- factor(data$Nuclear_stage, ordered = T, levels = c("BZP", "DG", "MT"))
data$replicate <- as.factor(data$Replicate)
```

After importing and preparing the data, the next step was to obtain some basic summary statistics.

```{r}
# Mean acrosomal integrity by treatment and time
means <- aggregate(Percentage2 ~ Nuclear_stage*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "mean")

# SDs by treatment and time
sds <- aggregate(Percentage2 ~ Nuclear_stage*Treatment, data = data, FUN = "sd")

means$SD <- sds$Percentage2
names(means)[3] <- c("Mean")

kable(means, format="markdown", digits = 3, align = "c", caption = "Basic summary statistics on the oocyte data.")
```

After an initial visual verification, we found that we needed to assess whether there was any evidence of under/overdispersion in the data. This was done by estimating the dispersion parameter of the data. 


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Test if the data are under/overdispersed
quasi_binom <- glm(Percentage2 ~ Treatment + Nuclear_stage, data = data, family=quasibinomial)
summary(quasi_binom)
```

These results indicate that the dispersion parameter was `r round(summary(quasi_binom)$dispersion,3)`.

### Mature cells
We used generalised linear regression models to assess the effects of MP exposure on the percentage of mature oocytes after a 24 hour maturation period. For these analyses all models had a quasi-binomial error distribution to account for the fact that the data were underdispersed percentages, ranging between 0 -- 1. We also included random intercepts to account for any differences across replicates.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
MT.fit <- glmmPQL(Percentage2 ~ Treatment,
                  random = ~ 1|Replicate,
                  family=quasibinomial,
                  data = data[which(data$Nuclear_stage == "MT"),])

summary(MT.fit)

# Tukey post-hoc test
MT.TUKEY <- glht(MT.fit,
                 mcp(Treatment = "Tukey"),
                 data = data[which(data$Nuclear_stage == "MT"),])
summary(MT.TUKEY)
```


<br>

These results indicate that exposure to MPs resulted in significantly reduced oocyte maturation rates compared to the control. A Tukey post-hoc comparison found that while exposure to both the 0.3 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ and 1.1 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ MP beads resulted in significantly lower maturation rates than the control, there was no significant difference between the two sized beads. 


### Degraded cells
We used generalised linear regression models to assess the effects of MP exposure on the percentage of degraded oocytes after a 24 hour maturation period. For these analyses all models had a quasi-binomial error distribution to account for the fact that the data were underdispersed percentages, ranging between 0 -- 1. We also included random intercepts to account for any differences across replicates.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
DG.fit <- glmmPQL(Percentage2 ~ Treatment,
                  random = ~ 1|Replicate,
                  family=quasibinomial,
                  data = data[which(data$Nuclear_stage == "DG"),])

summary(DG.fit)

# Tukey post-hoc test
DG.TUKEY <- glht(DG.fit,
                 mcp(Treatment = "Tukey"),
                 data = data[which(data$Nuclear_stage == "DG"),])
summary(DG.TUKEY)
```


<br>

These results indicate that exposure to MPs tended to result in a higher percentage of degraded oocyte compared to the control, but the effects were not statistically significant. A Tukey post-hoc comparison found no evidence of any pair-wise differences. 


### Broken zona pellucidae
We used generalised linear regression models to assess the effects of MP exposure on the percentage of oocytes with broken zona pellucidae after a 24 hour maturation period. For these analyses all models had a quasi-binomial error distribution to account for the fact that the data were underdispersed percentages, ranging between 0 -- 1. We also included random intercepts to account for any differences across replicates.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
BZP.fit <- glmmPQL(Percentage2 ~ Treatment,
                   random = ~ 1|Replicate,
                   family=quasibinomial,
                   data = data[which(data$Nuclear_stage == "BZP"),])

summary(BZP.fit)

# Tukey post-hoc test
BZP.TUKEY <- glht(BZP.fit,
                  mcp(Treatment = "Tukey"),
                  data = data[which(data$Nuclear_stage == "BZP"),])
summary(BZP.TUKEY)
```


<br>

These results indicate that exposure to MPs resulted in a significantly higher percentage of oocytes with broken zona pellucidae after a 24 hour maturation period compared to the control. A Tukey post-hoc comparison found that while exposure to both the 0.3 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ and 1.1 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ MP beads resulted in significantly more broken zona pellucidae than the control, there was no significant difference in the number of broken zona pellucidae between the two size treatments. A figure of the results across all three metrics is shown below. Note: Here again the code used to generate the figure are not shown.

## Proteomics

### Data scaling

The first step was to transform the raw data so that they would be on the same scale. To render the data comparable across species and developmental stages, data were scaled using Probabilistic Quotient Normalisation (PQN; Dieterle et al. 2006), which calibrates individual gene expression profiles against the median profile. Notably, analyses on PQN transformed data have been shown to have low false-positive rates, and can accurately recover groups of interest without introducing artefactual differences (Noonan et al. 2018).

### Random Forest Classification

After the data were transformed, a random forest (RF) model was used to classify protein expression profiles according to whether or not the oocytes were exposed to microplastics, with scaled gene expression values as the prediction variables. This allowed us to determine how well information contained within the proteomics data could be used to predict MP exposure. These analyses were conducted using the R package randomForest (RColorBrewer and Liaw, 2018). We chose RF modeling as it does not require any parameter reduction prior to analysis (Cutler et al. 2007). Identification of genes important for classifying groups of interest in each RF model was carried out using RF variable importance values.


```{r}
#Create a dataset that has information on MP exposure vs. controls
Treatment_Data <- data
Treatment_Data$Treatment <- Treatment


#Run the random forest model identifying MP exposure treatments
exposure.mod <- randomForest(y = Treatment_Data$Treatment,
                              x = Treatment_Data[, colnames(Treatment_Data) != "Treatment"],
                              mtry =  5,
                              ntree= 20000,
                              importance=TRUE,
                              proximity = TRUE,
                              keep.forest=TRUE,
                              replace = TRUE)

exposure.mod


confusionMatrix(exposure.mod$predicted, Treatment_Data$Treatment)

varImpPlot(exposure.mod, type=1, scale = FALSE)
```

These results indicate that the RF model was able to classify samples with versus without MP exposure with an accuracy of ca. 65%. However, this did not represent a significant improvement over the null, no-information rate of classification. Figure of these results are depicted below.

## Differentially Expressed Proteins (DEPs)

Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of normalized data were identified using the R package `limma`. An adjusted p-value to correct for multiple testing was calculated using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The most widely used correction for genomic studies is the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction, that aims to control the FDR across significant genes.
